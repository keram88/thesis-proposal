\section{Equivalence Checking using Boogie as an Intermediate Verification Language}
Program correctness is known to be difficult to prove.
%
Languages, such as Dafny, provide for verification constructs at the language level, allowing programs to be proved correct.
%
However, usage of these languages requires user expertise in helping a verifier construct a proof for the program.
%
These verified programming languages often provide translators to other programming languages such as C, Java, or Rust.
%
These programming languages are more amenable for a ``normal'' development cycle.
%
There are concerns arising from the use of this translated code, including:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item there may be errors in the translation.
%
\item the style of the generated code may not be ``idiomatic'' in style for the target language.
%
\item a translated program may drift away from the verified program, necessitating porting of changes back for verification.
\end{itemize}
Each of these could be addressed by performing \textit{equivalence checking} between the verified program and the other program.
